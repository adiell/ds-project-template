# ds-project-template

Cookiecutter template for data science project. Inspired by other templates such as
[cookiecutter-reproducible-science](https://github.com/mkrapp/cookiecutter-reproducible-science),
[dslp-repo-template](https://github.com/dslp/dslp-repo-template/)
and 
[cookiecutter-data-science](https://github.com/drivendata/cookiecutter-data-science).

On top of some minor changes in project structure, one of the main contribution is support for running on AWS Sagemaker.
